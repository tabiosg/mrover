## Project Overview
The science_board codebase deals with reading and parsing NMEA like messages
from the STM32 chip on the science PCB over UART to complete tasks for almost
every mission. These tasks include operating the science box and getting
relevant data during the Science task, controlling the arm laser during the
Equipment Servicing task, and controlling the LED array used during the
Autonomous Traversal task.

## Hardware
- NVIDIA JetsonNX
- PCB with a STM32G050C8 chip
- RX/TX connection cables 

---

## Top Level Code

#### [`science_board.py`](./science_board.py)

This program runs main.
This reads NMEA like messages via UART from the STM32 chip and depending on the
data received, it will publish the data to ROS topics.

In order for the user to control devices such as heaters and various LEDs,
this program acts as the server for various services. Upon receiving
a service request, the program will send an NMEA like message via UART to the
STM32 chip to issue out the command.

Locks exist to prevent two functions from trying to access the UART line at the same time

## Configuration

#### [`science_board.yaml`](../../../config/science_board.yaml)

This configuration file allows you to configure various things.

#### LED Array to UART Mapping - science_board/led_to_id/

You may choose to configure what number to pack
into the UART message in order to get the particular color to appear on the
LED Array. This must be consistent with the firmware flashed on the STM32 chip.

#### Device to MOSFET Number Mapping - science_board/device_mosfet_numbers/

You may choose to configure which device maps to which MOSFET device number.
This must be consistent to which MOSFET device number the device is connected to electrically.

#### UART Serial Info - science_board/serial/

You may choose to configure the UART serial info, such as baud rate and timeout.
The baud rate must be consistent with the firmware flased on the STM32 chip.

#### Miscellaneous Info - science_board/info/

You may choose to configure settings such as
the sleep duration and the length of every UART message transmitted.
The UART transmit message length must be consistent with the firmware flashed on the
STM32 chip.

## TODO
- [ ] IMPORTANT - UPDATE SPECTRAL NMEA MESSAGE IN HARDWARE, make sure to also maybe change length of msg
- [ ] simplify the mapper logic (can put into a function instead), don't need both _handler_function_by_tag and _ros_publisherr_by_tag probably
- [ ] Analyze behavior when MOSFET device is out of bounds. See if it should be handled by firmware or here or both.
It is preferred if it is both, but this program does not currently have any checking.
- [ ] Code clean up
- [ ] Move beaglebone stuff into config file
- [ ] Test with ROS
- [ ] Make sure messages and topics are consistent with the gui and teleop programs
- [ ] Perhaps make it so that if there is a hardware mapping problem,
it can be fixed in the config instead of reflashing the firmware (would prob make
life easier if there is a map issue... only problem is that you'll need
to rewrite logic for auto shutoff which can be annoying.)

---

## TODO - ROS Migration
- [ ] See if code builds in ROS
- [ ] See if UART locks work. If they do not, maybe try to revert back to how it worked in 2022 code?
Otherwise, need to deal with exception handling. If that does not work either, then look for another
solution.
