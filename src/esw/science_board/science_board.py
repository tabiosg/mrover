''' Manages communication to and from the science board.

The science_board codebase deals with reading and parsing NMEA like messages
from the STM32 chip on the science PCB over UART to complete tasks for almost
every mission. These tasks include operating the science box and getting
relevant data during the Science task, controlling the arm laser during the
Equipment Servicing task, and controlling the LED array used during the
Autonomous Traversal task.
